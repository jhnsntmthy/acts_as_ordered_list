v.1.1.1 - Wed May 16 2007
  - renamed syblings to siblings
  - renamed self_and_syblings to self_and_siblings
  - some other minor code changes
  - tests re-written to use fixtures (much faster)
    NOTE: I'm experiencing some strange issues with the test fixtures.
          See the notes in the test for details.
          This will not be merged with trunk
          until I can resolve this.
